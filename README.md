# Project: Testing Practice

This repository contains a solution for the
["Project: Testing Practice" lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice)
from The Odin Project, where we practice writing tests for various JavaScript functions using Jest,
a popular testing library.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

-   `src/`: A directory containing the JavaScript files with the functions to be tested.
-   `tests/`: A directory containing the Jest test files for each of the functions in `src/`.
-   `package.json`: A file describing the project dependencies and scripts.
-   `README.md`: This file.

## Installation

To run the tests locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on
your system.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kasdeya/jest-the-odin-project`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd jest-the-odin-project`
3. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

To run the tests, simply run the following command:

`npm test`

This will run all of the tests in the `tests/` directory using Jest.
